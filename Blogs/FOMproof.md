Right now I am currently taking a Foundations of Mathematics course where we discuss mathematical logic, well it's a lot more than that I guess but that's the overarching idea I think? Point is one of the things we get into is proofs. Obviously we're starting out easier, it only starts to actually get hard towards the end/when I will eventually take analysis. 
Here's a proof we worked on in class and the negation of said proof. We were also given some phrases and made it a quantifier and the negation of a quantifier. <br/>
If you want to do it on ya own, I find them pretty interesting so I'll put them here for now. <br/>
If x is odd, then x^2 is odd <br/>

For each of the following:
1. Write it as a quantified statement.
2. Write its negation.
- Every dog has its day
- We are all in the same boat
- When it rains, it pours
- all that glitters is not gold.
