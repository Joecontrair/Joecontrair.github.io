When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
\[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]

1. Even proof

Proposition: Suppose a,b ∈ $Z$, If a and b are even, then ab is even. 

Proof: Suppose a,b∈$Z$, by definition of even there exists integers K and Q such that a = 2K and b = 2Q. From this a*b = 2k*2Q which we can then simplify into 4KQ = 2(2KQ). Let M = 2KQ. Since $Z$ is closed under multiplication and 2,K,Q∈$Z$, 2KQ∈$Z$. Thus ab = 2M where 2M is an integer and so by definition, ab is even. ∎

2. Divides

Definition: Suppose that a,b∈$Z$. We say that b divides a, denoted b|a, when there exists an integer k such that a = bk. 

Does 2|10? Yes 2|10 because 10 = 2*5. 
Does 4|10? 4 does not divide 10 because if 10 = 4k then k = 2.5 /∈ $Z$

Synonyms: 
- b is a divisor of a
- b is a factor of a
- a is a multiple of b
- $\frac a{b}$ is an integer. [k = $\frac a{b}$]

3. Proofs

Prove the following:

Proposition: Suppose that a,b,c∈$Z$. If b|a and b|c then b|(a+c). 

Proof: Suppose that a,b,c∈$Z$. By definition of divides there exists an integer k where a = bk and an integer k$_1$ where c = bk$_1$. So from this we get (a+c) = b(k+k$_1$). Since the integers are closed under addition k+k$_1$ must be an integer. Because of that by definition of divides b|(a+c). ∎


Proposition: Suppose that x,y,z∈$Z$. If x|y and y|z, then x|z. 

Proof: Suppose that x,y,z∈$Z$. By definition of divides there exists an integer g where y = xg and an integer f where z = yf. From this we can get z = xgf, simplifying it would get $\frac z{xg}$ = f. Because $\frac z{y}$ is an integer, $\frac x{zg}$ must be an integer. (Or Since $Z$ is closed under multiplication, $\frac x{zg}$∈$Z$). Therefore x|z. ∎

- From this we can get z = xgf. Here I can actually just set z = x(gf) and then follow it with Since $Z$ is closed under multiplication x(gf)∈$Z$. Therefore x|z. ∎
I just made it a little more complicated then needed.
