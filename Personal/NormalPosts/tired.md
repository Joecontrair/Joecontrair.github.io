# Mannnnn
I was doing so good at the beginning of this semester D= 
I was managing to keep up with my homework and I was actually doing the readings (Okay well I was doing the readings for my number theory course but still!). I was genuinely excited for this semester, but every single time I start to get into the flow I get overwelmed one day and just stop it all. I feel like all I do is do my job and then get home and bum around. I am so tired all the time and I dont know how to fix it. I don't wish to quit my jobs because they're easy enough and I like having money/I need some to makeup for failing in the past.
