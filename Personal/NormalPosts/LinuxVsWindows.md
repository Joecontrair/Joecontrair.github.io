## What are they
So Windows and Linux are two different Operating systems that have been around for a pretty long time (continuously updated ofcourse). Windows is developed and owned by Microsoft and is sadly losed source. It's original release, Windows 1, was in 1985. It is currently on it's 9th iteration, windows 11 and will probably be updating that for a couple years. Linux is an OS that was released in 1991 by Linus Torvdalds. At it's core it's sort of bare bones shell I guess? (I'm sure this is not an accurate description because it's a kernal not a shell but for people who aren't tech savy, like me, might understand it better). 

### Windows in more detail
So Windows overall is probably alot easier for most people to get ahold of and use. It comes built in with a lot of computers and you'll be able to update to the next Windows release if you're computer isn't too old. Way more things are more compatible with windows compared to Linux, I believe even video games don't all necessarily work on a Linux system. Or it certainly isn't as easy to make work, as it doesn't have a natural support for it. All valve games are made so they can be played on a linux system though!
