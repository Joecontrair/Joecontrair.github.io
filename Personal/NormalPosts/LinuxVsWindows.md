## What are they
So Windows and Linux are two different Operating systems that have been around for a pretty long time (continuously updated ofcourse). Windows is developed and owned by Microsoft and is sadly losed source. It's original release, Windows 1, was in 1985. It is currently on it's 9th iteration, windows 11 and will probably be updating that for a couple years. Linux is an OS that was released in 1991 by Linus Torvdalds. At it's core it's sort of bare bones shell I guess? (I'm sure this is not an accurate description because it's a kernal not a shell but for people who aren't tech savy, like me, might understand it better). 

### Windows in more detail
So Windows overall is probably alot easier for most people to get ahold of and use. It comes built in with a lot of computers and you'll be able to update to the next Windows release if your computer isn't too old. Way more things are more compatible with windows compared to Linux, I believe even video games don't all necessarily work on a Linux system. Or it certainly isn't as easy to make work, as it doesn't have a natural support for it. All valve games are made so they can be played on a linux system though! Kind following along with the compatability thing there's alot of built in feature that some people, especially htose getting into business things might find appealing to use and even upgrade such as Microsoft Office space.(You can run this on Mac and Linux but might take a little more effort?)

### Linux in more detail
So the big thing with Linux is that it's Open source! Big deal to some people as they appreciate being able to look at the source code behind the things they are going to be running on their PC. Linux at it's core is just the Linux kernal and there are a shit ton of distributions out there that are great for really personalising your desktop.Now what makes one distribution better for security, or one better for gaming etc. I could not tell you. In general Linux is considered alot more secure as way less people use it so people don't tend to make things that target them. 

## Conclusion
I don't know man, Windows is pretty easy to manage and tends to come downloaded on many computers. If you're lookin to only game on your comp, Windows all the way but if you wanna use it for anything else? I don't know you could probably go either way, and I'd bet if you got used to the linux system you could probably get some great use out of it, atleast if you're a progammer but as someone who mostly casually uses the comp it just doesn't seem worth it. But I'm sure someone could convince me otherwise, like I said don't actually listen to me, everything here is just some stuff I've been told/some basic googling and such.
