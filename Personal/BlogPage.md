# Welcome to the Daly
Welcome to the Blog Page. Here I will hopefully have an index of Blogs or something? Definitely going to upload things I've been learning and working on in my Math courses, maybe some normal blog stuff too!

<!-- Comment -->
# Posts
Here I'll probably just have random posts and things that I'm testing out.

# FOM stuff I did
Old proofs and puzzles we did in my FOM course last year. <br/>
[Negations](Pages/FOMproof.md)<br/>
[Knights And Knaves](Pages/KnightsAndKnaves.md) <br/>
[Simple odd proof](Pages/OddProof.md)<br/>
[Various proofs](Pages/Several-proofs.md)<br/>
[Division Algorithm](Pages/DivisionAlgorithm.md)<br/>
[Congruence and Contrapositive](Pages/3-21-Class.md)<br/>
[Some more proofs](Pages/MoreHWProofs.md)<br/>
## Newer Number theory stuff
I'm taking a number theory course and I figured I'd do what I did with FOM and upload some proofs and stuff that we worked on <br/>

# Interesting things
Here I'll probably just post links to random websites or just things I found interesting
<br/>
On of my professors has her own website! Shes got some neat artwork and some fun things of her own going on! <br/>
