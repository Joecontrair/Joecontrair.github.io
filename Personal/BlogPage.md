# Welcome to the Daly
Welcome to the Blog Page. Here I will hopefully have an index of Blogs or something? Definitely going to upload things I've been learning in FOM such as proofs and other interesting puzzles we've been working on. 

<!-- Comment -->
# Posts
Here I'll probably just have random posts and things that I'm testing out. 
[Post 1](NormalPosts/Post1.md)<br/>

# Math/proofs
This is where I'll upload proofs and various puzzles that we've been working on in class<br/>
[Negations](Pages/FOMproof.md)<br/>
[Knights And Knaves](Pages/KnightsAndKnaves.md) <br/>
[Simple odd proof](Pages/OddProof.md)<br/>
[Various proofs](Pages/Several-proofs.md)<br/>
[Division Algorithm](Pages/DivisionAlgorithm.md)<br/>
[Congruence and Contrapositive](Pages/3-21-Class.md)<br/>
[Some more proofs](Pages/MoreHWProofs.md)<br/>
## New math proofs and such
I haven't uploaded in forever and decided to start back up because I'm taking a really interesting number theory course
[Day 7 or something idk](NumberTheoryStuffs/Class7.md)


# Interesting things
Here I'll probably just post links to random websites or just things I found interesting
<br/>
My professor has her own website actually! Shes got some neat artwork and some fun things of her own going on! <br/>
