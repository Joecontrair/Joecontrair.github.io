This was a little Logic puzzle that we did in FOM a few weeks back to give us an idea of If P, then Q. OR atleast I assume that was the purpose of it. I think it's based off of some puzzle book by Raymond Smullyan or something which had one particular one about an island with Knights and Knaves but my professor changed it up a little bit for various reasons. <br/>
