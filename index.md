# About Me:
Hey, I'm Joe Daly here to give you Joe Daily. I'm a student enrolled at St Mary's College of Maryland studying Mathematics with a minor in both Philosophy and Business. I currently work 3 jobs on campus and hope to continue building up my Resume! As of last year I have taken up climbing and can now do up to V5s, and recently have started learning a little bit of computer science. <br/>

# Blog: 
I honestly don't have all that much to talk about but I figured I'd make a little blog page anyway! [Blog](BlogPage.md)

# Resume: 
This is my General Resume, essentially a list of all previous job experience and relevant educational experiences.
