# Welcome! 
Hey welcome to my blog! I honestly don't know what I will be posting here. I am currently taking a Foundations of Mathematics course where we discuss many different foundational
techniques and proofs in mathematics. I figured I'll probably upload some of the proofs I'll be attempting and some of the more interesting things I've gotten from this course!
